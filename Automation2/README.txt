My first back-End java project based on JavaEE.

MVC, AOP, OOP, REST, N-Layer pattern used for developement.

You may need to manualy add glassfish-HK2 jar files in your maven repository directory.

The following technologies used in this application
  Spring Framework (AOP (AspectJ) - Beans - Boot - MVC).
  Jersey (AssertJ - JUnit5 - Mockito).
  Java DataBase Connector (JDBC-MySQL).
  Slf4J Logging library.
  Servlet and JSF with JSTL library for jsp files.
  For database section Hibernate is also included and will complete soon.

This application developed with SpringBoot base
  So, you have to run Automation2Application.java class to start the server
  Note: The localhost port is (8085).

For compiling java files intelliJ ide is highly recommended and XAMPP server
  should must start and database should create in phpMyAdmin page.
  
I hope you can enjoy this app ...
